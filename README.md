**MAKE SURE to import the inner folder, if you import the outer folder as project it will cause error**
## Overview
A short project I made based on Fight List to practice
Fight List is an online multiplayer game, each round the player is given a topic and they must type as many things that are associated with the topic as fast as possible
This project is a mini version of that where it is single-player, and there are not many topics.
It is finished, but I will build on it as I learn more.

## Features added

- Time-based round
- Scoreboard saved in an external file
- Reveal answer
- Ability to add more questions (Pressing 7 in the main menu)

## Features to be added
- To be played on an application window instead of a console
- Make the interface to make more sense
- Connect to online database to contain high scores and questions
